This project includes tools and code to use TensorFlow and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to anticipate Microsoft stock values. The objective is to create a model that, using past data, can predict future stock prices with accuracy.
The dataset used for training and testing the model is historical Microsoft stock price data. The dataset should be provided as a CSV file, containing the following columns:
Date: The date of the stock price record.

Open: The opening price of the stock on that day.

High: The highest price of the stock on that day.

Low: The lowest price of the stock on that day.

Close: The closing price of the stock on that day.

Volume: The trading volume of the stock on that day.

Tech Used
Python,TensorFlow,Pandas,NumPy,Matplotlib

Upon executing the code, the test set's anticipated Microsoft stock values as well as a comparison between the predicted and actual prices are visualized.
The ideas and methods from the domains of time series analysis and deep learning are the foundation of the code in this repository.
